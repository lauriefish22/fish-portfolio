## Description

I have created a portfolio for myself to showcase the projects I have completed as well as contact information.  This will be used to send out to employers for possible job opportunities.  

## Components:

-Navigation bar will bring you to specific projects completed as well as my contact information.
-There are 5 projects shown and if you click on the link (at some point) you will reach the project in it's entirety.  
-A brief description about myslef as well as a photo
-Contact information is in the footer containing links to email, Linkedin, Github and phone number.

## Example coding

-this HTML represents the images/boxes of previous projects.

```<!-- all 4 boxes of projects -->
        <div class="all-box"> 
            <div class="box" id="Monster">
                <h1 class="title">Monster Capture</h1>
                <img src="./Assets/yeti-575808_640.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="box" id="board">
                <h1 class="title">Swap or Sell</h1>
                <img src="./Assets/board.jpeg"/>
            </div>
            <div class="box" id="star">
                <h1 class="title">Star Jewelers</h1>
                <img src="./Assets/jewelry-store-1803808_640.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <div class="box" id="pool">
                <h1 class="title">Sports Pool</h1>
                <img src="./Assets/football-83513_640.jpg"/>
            </div>
        </div>```


## Learning Points

I need to go back and fix the media settings as I struggled way too long on those and am missing something.  The understanding of flexbox are coming along but more time is needed of course to feel comfortable with them.
